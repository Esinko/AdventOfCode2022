# AdventOfCode2022
My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions.

**Solutions, where?**

All solutions are in the `challenges` folder. Yet again, I am using `Node.js` (`>=v16.16.0`)

If you think my solutions are optimized or otherwise shitty, too bad. I am not fixing them after I get them working :)

**Why?**

For me Advent of Code is about trying to write good and quality code from the start. I also like to explore new ways of exploiting JavaScript array prototypes.
